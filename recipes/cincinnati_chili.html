<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Cincinnati chili (or Cincinnati-style chili) is a 
    Mediterranean-spiced meat sauce used as a topping for 
    spaghetti or hot dogs ("coneys"); both dishes were 
    developed by Macedonian immigrant restaurateurs in 
    the 1920s. In 2013, Smithsonian named it one of the 
    "20 Most Iconic Foods in America". Its name evokes 
    comparison to chili con carne, but the two are dissimilar 
    in consistency, flavor, and serving method; Cincinnati 
    chili more closely resembles Greek pasta sauces and 
    spiced-meat hot dog topping sauces seen in other parts 
    of the United States.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 quart water, or amount to cover</li>
    <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vinegar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 (1 ounce) square unsweetened chocolate</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>5 whole cloves</li>
    <li>5 whole allspice berries</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Place the ground beef in a large pan, cover with 
        about 1 quart of cold water, and bring to a boil, 
        stirring and breaking up the beef with a fork to a 
        fine texture. Slowly boil until the meat is thoroughly 
        cooked, about 30 minutes, then remove from heat and 
        refrigerate in the pan overnight.
    </li>
    <li>
        The next day, skim the solid fat from the top of the pan, 
        and discard the fat. Place the beef mixture over medium heat, 
        and stir in the onions, tomato sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire
        sauce, garlic, chocolate, chili powder, salt, cumin, cinnamon,
        cayenne pepper, cloves, allspice berries, and bay leaf. 
        Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, 
        stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. Add water if necessary 
        to prevent the chili from burning.
